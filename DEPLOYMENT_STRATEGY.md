# AMTA Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive deployment strategy for the AMTA project, detailing our approach to reliable, secure, and efficient application deployment.

## Deployment Workflow

### Stages
1. **Pre-Deployment Readiness**
   - System configuration validation
   - Environment checks
   - Dependency verification

2. **Docker Image Preparation**
   - Backend and frontend image builds
   - Container registry push
   - Version tagging

3. **EC2 Deployment**
   - Secrets retrieval
   - Configuration management
   - Service startup
   - Health verification

## Verification Tools

### Pre-Deployment Validation
- `deployment_readiness.sh`
  * Checks system configuration
  * Validates environment variables
  * Ensures deployment prerequisites are met

### Database Connectivity
- `docker_db_connectivity.sh`
  * Verifies database connection
  * Checks network accessibility
  * Provides detailed connectivity diagnostics

- `verify_database_connectivity.sh`
  * Multi-mode database connection testing
  * Supports different deployment environments
  * Comprehensive error reporting

### Deployment Verification
- `verify_deployment.sh`
  * Comprehensive system health check
  * Validates service startup
  * Confirms inter-service communication

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Workflow Stages
1. Deployment Readiness Verification
2. Debug and Context Verification
3. Docker Image Retrieval
4. AWS Credentials Configuration
5. Secrets Management
6. EC2 Deployment
7. Health Checks
8. Logging and Artifact Preservation

### Deployment Modes
- `production`
- `development`
- `docker-production`

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management
- Use AWS Secrets Manager
- Avoid hardcoded credentials
- Implement least-privilege access
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Security Considerations
- Minimal network exposure
- Comprehensive health checks
- Detailed logging
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient Docker image builds
- Minimal deployment overhead
- Quick rollback mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Database connection failures
- Secrets management errors
- Docker image compatibility

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Review deployment logs
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow output
3. Verify AWS Secrets Manager configuration
4. Validate network and firewall settings

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Comprehensive workflow logs
- Detailed error reporting
- Artifact preservation

### Metrics
- Deployment duration
- Success/failure rates
- Service startup times

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
- Regular workflow review
- Performance analysis
- Security assessment
- Tool refinement

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Strategy
- Preserve previous deployment artifacts
- Quick rollback mechanism
- Minimal service disruption
