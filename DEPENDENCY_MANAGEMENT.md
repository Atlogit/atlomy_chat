# AMTA Dependency Management Guide

## Overview
Effective dependency management is crucial for maintaining the security, performance, and reliability of the AMTA project.

## Dependency Update Strategy

### Automated Updates
- Weekly dependency checks
- Automatic security vulnerability scanning
- Pull request generation for updates
- Manual trigger option available

### Update Workflow Details
- **Frequency**: Every Monday at 2 AM
- **Tools Used**:
  - pip-tools for requirements management
  - Safety for security checks
  - Snyk for vulnerability scanning

## Dependency Management Best Practices

### Version Pinning
- Use exact versions in `requirements.txt`
- Avoid using `>=` or `*` wildcards
- Specify minimal version requirements

### Security Considerations
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor security advisories
- Use automated scanning tools
- Perform manual security reviews

## Dependency Update Process

### Automated Workflow Steps
1. Check for outdated packages
2. Generate list of updates
3. Run safety checks
4. Create pull request with updates
5. Perform vulnerability scanning

### Manual Update Procedure
```bash
# Update pip and pip-tools
pip install --upgrade pip pip-tools

# Compile and update requirements
pip-compile requirements.txt

# Check for security vulnerabilities
safety check
```

## Dependency Types

### Production Dependencies
- Core functionality requirements
- Minimal and essential packages
- Carefully vetted for stability

### Development Dependencies
- Testing tools
- Linters
- Type checkers
- Not included in production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Version conflicts
- Incompatible package requirements
- Security vulnerabilities

### Resolution Strategies
- Isolate conflicting dependencies
- Use virtual environments
- Gradually update packages
- Test thoroughly after updates

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Tools
- GitHub Dependabot
- Snyk
- Safety
- pip-audit

### Reporting
- Weekly update reports
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Dependency health dashboard

## Compliance and Documentation

### Version Tracking
- Maintain detailed `CHANGELOG.md`
- Document significant dependency changes
- Note security patches and updates

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep previous `requirements.txt`
- Maintain deployment artifacts
- Quick rollback mechanism
- Comprehensive testing after updates

## Contributing Guidelines

### Dependency Addition
1. Justify new dependency
2. Verify security
3. Check performance impact
4. Update documentation
5. Run comprehensive tests
