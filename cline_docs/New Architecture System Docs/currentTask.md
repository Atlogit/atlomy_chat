# Current Task: Frontend Updates and Redis Caching Implementation

## Current Focus
Updating frontend components to work with the new database schema and implementing Redis caching for improved performance.

## Completed Components
[Previous completed components remain checked...]

- [x] Database Schema Updates
  - [x] Removed old book_level structure
  - [x] Implemented citation and structural components
  - [x] Added title-specific fields
  - [x] Updated documentation to reflect changes
- [x] Redis Caching Implementation
  - [x] Added Redis configuration
  - [x] Implemented Redis client utility
  - [x] Updated CorpusService with caching
  - [x] Added cache invalidation strategies
- [x] API Layer Updates
  - [x] Updated API types to match new schema
  - [x] Added proper typing for citation components
  - [x] Enhanced error handling
  - [x] Added cache-aware endpoints

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Component Updates
   - Update TextDisplay component for new schema
   - Update ListTexts component for metadata display
   - Update SearchForm for new search parameters
   - Update CorpusSection for overall structure

2. Testing and Validation
   - Test Redis caching effectiveness
   - Validate frontend updates
   - Verify data consistency
   - Performance testing with caching

## Technical Context
Currently working with:
- Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- Updated database schema with citation components
- Frontend components in Next.js
- TypeScript types for API integration
- FastAPI backend with async support
- SQLAlchemy models with new schema

## Implementation Notes
- Citation components now include author_id_field, work_number_field, etc.
- Structural components include volume, chapter, line, section
- Title handling improved with is_title flag and related fields
- Redis caching implemented for frequently accessed data
- Frontend components being updated to match new data structure
- API types updated to reflect schema changes

## Considerations
- Cache invalidation strategies must be robust
- Frontend updates must maintain UX consistency
- Performance impact of Redis caching needs monitoring
- Error handling must account for cache misses
- Documentation must stay in sync with changes
- Testing should cover both cached and uncached paths

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database
- SQLAlchemy async support
- FastAPI backend
- Python 3.9+
- spaCy with custom model
- Multiprocessing support
- Redis server
- aioredis >= 2.0.0
- Updated frontend dependencies
