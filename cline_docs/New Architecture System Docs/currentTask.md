# Current Task: Migration Toolkit Development and Testing

## Current Focus
Developing and testing the migration toolkit for transferring text data to the new PostgreSQL database structure.

## Completed Components

- [x] Citation migration tool with robust parsing
- [x] Text viewing utilities (both direct and service-based)
- [x] Basic error handling and logging
- [x] Initial data validation checks
- [x] Content validation implementation
  - [x] Basic content validation (empty, whitespace)
  - [x] Unicode content validation (Greek, Arabic, Chinese)
  - [x] Special characters validation
  - [x] Content length validation
- [x] Citation format validation tests
- [x] Citation structural validation tests
- [x] Post-migration verification tools
- [x] Data integrity checks
- [x] Batch processing implementation
- [x] Performance optimizations
  - [x] Batch processing
  - [x] Enhanced caching
  - [x] Query optimization
- [x] NLP Processing Integration
  - [x] Sentence segmentation using existing parsers
  - [x] spaCy pipeline integration
  - [x] Batch processing for NLP
  - [x] Progress tracking and logging
- [x] Test and validate NLP processing
  - [x] Test sentence segmentation accuracy
  - [x] Validate NLP analysis results
  - [x] Performance testing with large texts
  - [x] Memory usage monitoring
  - [x] Error handling and recovery
  - [x] Cache behavior testing
- [x] Advanced processing features
  - [x] Parallel processing support
  - [x] Progress tracking improvements
  - [x] Error recovery enhancements
- [x] Integration testing of parallel processing
  - [x] Test with large datasets (5 texts, 20 divisions/text, 50 lines/division)
  - [x] Verify data consistency across parallel processes
  - [x] Monitor system resource usage (memory, processing time)
  - [x] Performance testing with different batch sizes and worker counts
  - [x] Error recovery testing with invalid data

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive integration tests
   - Execute the new test suite
   - Analyze performance metrics
   - Review error handling effectiveness

2. Performance tuning based on test results
   - Optimize batch sizes based on metrics
   - Adjust worker count for optimal performance
   - Fine-tune caching strategies

## Technical Context
Currently working with:
- CitationMigrator: Handles parsing and migration of citations
- ContentValidator: Validates text content (Unicode, special chars, length)
- CitationProcessor: Handles citation parsing and processing
- DataVerifier: Handles post-migration verification
- CorpusProcessor: Coordinates text processing and NLP analysis
- ParallelProcessor: Manages parallel processing of corpus texts
- Text viewing utilities: Both direct database access and service-layer abstraction
- SQLAlchemy models: Author, Text, TextDivision, TextLine
- Alembic migrations: Database schema management

## Implementation Notes
- Citation parsing handles complex formats with multiple components
- Content validation supports Unicode and special characters
- Structural validation ensures data integrity
- Caching implemented for authors and texts
- Error handling includes logging and recovery
- Database operations use async SQLAlchemy
- Batch processing optimizes performance
- Post-migration verification ensures data quality
- NLP processing integrated with existing parsers
- Sentence segmentation preserves line references
- Comprehensive test suite validates all components
- Parallel processing implemented with process pooling
- Progress tracking enhanced with real-time updates
- Error recovery mechanisms improved for parallel execution

## Considerations
- Data integrity is critical during migration
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- Error handling must be robust
- Documentation needs to be comprehensive
- Validation must handle all text formats (Greek, Arabic, etc.)
- NLP processing must be efficient
- Parallel processing must maintain data consistency
- Resource usage must be monitored and optimized

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database
- SQLAlchemy async support
- FastAPI backend
- Python 3.9+
- spaCy with custom model
- Multiprocessing support
