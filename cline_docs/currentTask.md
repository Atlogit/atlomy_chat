# Current Task: Prepare for Chatbot Interface Development

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implemented parallel processing for lexical value generation
  - Created ParallelLexicalGenerator with thread-safe storage
  - Added worker pools for citation processing
  - Implemented batch operations API endpoints
  - Created modern UI for batch operations
  - Added progress tracking and error handling
  - Updated documentation to reflect changes

## Next Objectives
- [ ] Design chatbot interface architecture
- [ ] Plan fact-based response system
- [ ] Expand test coverage for parallel processing
- [ ] Create user documentation for batch operations

## Context
The parallel processing implementation has been completed successfully. The system now supports:
- Thread-safe storage operations
- Concurrent citation processing
- Batch creation and updates
- Progress tracking UI
- Modern frontend with error handling
- Comprehensive API endpoints for batch operations

## Steps to Complete
1. Design chatbot interface
   - Research best practices for medical chatbots
   - Design conversation flow
   - Plan integration with existing components
   - Create wireframes for UI

2. Plan fact-based response system
   - Define fact verification process
   - Design citation integration
   - Plan response generation workflow
   - Create accuracy metrics

3. Expand test coverage
   - Add tests for parallel processing
   - Create performance benchmarks
   - Test batch operations
   - Add stress tests for concurrent operations

4. Create user documentation
   - Document batch operation workflows
   - Create usage guides
   - Add API documentation
   - Include performance recommendations

## Key Considerations
- Maintain thread safety in all operations
- Ensure data consistency across parallel processes
- Monitor performance metrics
- Keep documentation updated
- Follow established coding patterns
- Consider scalability in design decisions

## Next Steps After Completion
- Begin chatbot interface implementation
- Develop fact-based response system
- Plan additional ancient text source integrations
- Design flexible citation system

## Current Status
The application now has a fully functional parallel processing system with:
1. Backend Components:
   - Thread-safe storage
   - Worker pools for processing
   - Batch operation support
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

2. Frontend Features:
   - Batch creation interface
   - Batch update interface
   - Progress indicators
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Cancel operations

3. API Endpoints:
   - /api/lexical/batch-create
   - /api/lexical/batch-update
   - Progress reporting
   - Error responses

The focus can now shift to developing the chatbot interface while maintaining the stability and performance of the current implementation.
