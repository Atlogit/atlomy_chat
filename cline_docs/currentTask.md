- [ ] Create documentation for the new `useApi` hook and error handling patterns
- [ ] Refine error handling and API integration across components
- [ ] Prepare for chatbot interface development

## Context
We have successfully improved our testing infrastructure, API handling, and addressed the "socket hang up" issue in lexical value creation. The system now supports:
- Comprehensive Jest configuration for TypeScript and JSX
- Improved test coverage for API interactions
- A reusable `useApi` hook with retry mechanism and longer timeout
- Standardized error handling
- Error boundary for graceful error management
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimized batch operations with progress tracking
- Single attempt creation for lexical values with improved reliability
- Better user feedback for long-running operations

## Steps to Complete
1. Evaluate new reliability enhancements
   - Conduct stress tests for lexical value creation
   - Analyze logs for any remaining timeout or connection issues
   - Gather user feedback on the improved process

2. Optimize long-running operations
   - Identify potential bottlenecks in lexical value creation
   - Explore options for further parallelization or caching
   - Consider implementing progress indicators for users

3. Implement real-time updates
   - Research server-sent events and WebSocket implementations
   - Prototype real-time status updates for long-running tasks
   - Evaluate impact on server resources and client performance

4. Update documentation
   - Revise user guides to reflect new error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Document best practices for handling long-running operations
   - Update API documentation with new timeout and retry settings

5. Expand testing suite
   - Develop end-to-end tests for lexical value creation flow
   - Create performance benchmarks for API calls and batch operations
   - Implement stress tests for concurrent operations

6. Prepare for chatbot interface
   - Research best practices for medical chatbots
   - Design conversation flow, considering integration with lexical value creation
   - Plan integration with existing components
   - Create wireframes for UI, incorporating status updates for long-running operations

## Key Considerations
- Maintain balance between retry attempts and server load
- Ensure clear and informative user feedback during long-running operations
- Consider scalability and performance implications of real-time updates
- Keep documentation up-to-date, especially regarding error handling and long-running tasks
- Focus on user experience when refining error handling and status updates

## Next Steps After Completion
- Begin chatbot interface implementation
- Develop fact-based response system
- Plan additional ancient text source integrations
- Design flexible citation system

## Current Status
The application now has an improved reliability and performance profile, particularly for lexical value creation:
1. API Handling:
   - Reusable `useApi` hook with retry mechanism and longer timeout
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Single attempt creation for lexical values

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Caching in `useApi` hook
   - Optimized batch operations with progress tracking
   - Background tasks for long-running operations

3. User Experience:
   - Better feedback for long-running operations
   - Improved error reporting in UI
   - More reliable lexical value creation process

4. Testing and Documentation:
   - Expanded test coverage for API interactions
   - Updated documentation reflecting recent changes

The focus now is on thoroughly evaluating these enhancements, further optimizing long-running operations, implementing real-time updates, and preparing for the chatbot interface development while maintaining the improved reliability and performance of the current implementation.
