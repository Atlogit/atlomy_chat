# Current Task: Debug and Optimize Web Interface

## Objectives
- [x] Fix static file serving in web interface
- [x] Ensure proper component initialization
- [x] Debug API endpoints
- [x] Verify all functionality is working
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for lexical value generation
- [ ] Enhance feedback mechanism for improving lexical value quality
- [ ] Expand test coverage for all components

## Context
The web interface has been successfully debugged and is now functioning properly. All components (CorpusManager, LLMAssistant, LexicalValueGenerator) are initializing correctly and the API endpoints are responding as expected. The focus can now shift to implementing parallel processing and enhancing the feedback mechanism.

## Recent Accomplishments
1. Fixed static file serving by updating paths in index.html
2. Corrected logger initialization in api.py
3. Verified proper initialization of all components
4. Confirmed API endpoints are functioning correctly
5. Ensured proper error handling and logging
6. Updated documentation to reflect current state

## Steps to Complete
1. Design and implement parallel processing system for lexical value generation
   - Research best practices for parallel processing in Python
   - Identify bottlenecks in current implementation
   - Design thread-safe caching mechanism
   - Implement parallel processing while maintaining data consistency

2. Enhance feedback mechanism for lexical value quality
   - Design feedback collection system
   - Implement feedback integration into generation process
   - Create metrics for measuring lexical value quality
   - Develop system for incorporating feedback into future generations
   - Add feedback collection to web interface

3. Expand test coverage
   - Add tests for parallel processing functionality
   - Create tests for feedback mechanism
   - Add tests for web interface and API endpoints
   - Enhance existing test suite for better coverage
   - Add performance benchmarking tests

4. Update documentation
   - Document parallel processing implementation
   - Create user guide for feedback system
   - Update API documentation
   - Add performance optimization guidelines
   - Create web interface usage guide

## Key Considerations
- Ensure thread safety in parallel processing implementation
- Maintain data consistency across parallel operations
- Design efficient feedback collection and integration process
- Consider scalability in parallel processing design
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Keep documentation updated with new functionality
- Ensure web interface remains responsive under load

## Next Steps After Completion
- Begin development of chatbot interface
- Implement fact-based response system
- Plan integration with additional ancient text sources
- Design flexible citation formatting system
- Consider deployment strategies and requirements
- Enhance web interface with additional features:
  - Real-time updates
  - Interactive visualizations
  - Advanced search capabilities
  - Batch processing interface

## Current Status
The application is now running with a fully functional web interface that provides access to all core features:

1. LLM Assistant
   - Query ancient medical texts
   - Get detailed responses with references
   - Interactive interface for complex queries

2. Lexical Values Management
   - Create new lexical entries
   - Retrieve existing entries
   - Update translations
   - Delete entries
   - List all available entries

3. Corpus Manager
   - List available texts
   - Search through texts
   - Access full corpus
   - Search by lemma or text

All components are properly initialized and communicating:
- CorpusManager: Managing text corpus from correct directory
- LLMAssistant: Using Claude-3-sonnet for detailed responses
- LexicalValueGenerator: Using Claude-3-haiku for efficient processing
- FastAPI: Serving web interface and handling API requests

The focus can now shift to implementing parallel processing and enhancing the feedback system while maintaining the stability of the current implementation.
