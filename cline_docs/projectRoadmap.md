# Project Roadmap: Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App

## High-Level Goals
- [ ] Develop a full pipeline for analyzing ancient medical texts
- [ ] Implement a chatbot interface for user interactions
- [ ] Create a system for gathering references and creating lexical values
- [ ] Integrate LLMs and Langchain for advanced text processing
- [ ] Expand reference system beyond TLG to include other ancient text sources
- [ ] Implement flexible citation options to accommodate various academic standards

## Key Features
- [x] Corpus management system
- [x] Natural Language Processing pipeline for ancient texts
- [ ] Reference gathering and citation system
- [ ] Lexical value generation (summary and academic analysis)
- [ ] Chatbot interface for user queries
- [ ] Fact-based response system with reference backing
- [ ] Multi-source reference integration (TLG and beyond)
- [ ] Customizable citation formatting

## Completion Criteria
- Fully functional app that can process user queries about ancient medical texts
- Accurate reference gathering and citation from multiple sources
- High-quality summaries and academic analyses
- User-friendly chatbot interface
- Robust integration of LLMs and Langchain
- Flexible citation system supporting various academic standards

## Progress Tracker
- [x] Set up project structure and essential files
- [x] Implement corpus management system
- [x] Implement centralized logging system
- [x] Develop initial NLP pipeline for ancient text processing
- [ ] Create reference gathering and citation system
- [ ] Implement lexical value generation
- [ ] Integrate LLMs and Langchain
- [ ] Develop chatbot interface
- [ ] Implement fact-based response system
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and refinement
- [ ] Deploy the application
- [ ] Develop integrations for non-TLG ancient text sources
- [ ] Implement flexible citation formatting options

## Completed Tasks
- Set up project structure and essential files
- Created initial documentation (projectRoadmap.md, currentTask.md, techStack.md, codebaseSummary.md)
- Analyzed existing codebase and example files
- Developed detailed requirements document
- Implemented and tested centralized logging system
- Developed initial NLP pipeline for ancient Greek text processing
- Fixed import issues in TLG Parser and ensured all tests are passing

## Next Steps
- Design and implement lexical value generation system
- Plan integration between NLP pipeline and lexical value generation
- Research and plan LLM and Langchain integration
- Design user-friendly chatbot interface
- Plan fact-based response system implementation
- Research additional ancient text sources for future integration
- Investigate academic citation standards for flexible formatting

## Current Focus
- Preparing for lexical value generation implementation
- Designing integration between NLP pipeline and lexical value generation
- Enhancing corpus management capabilities to support lexical value generation

## Future Enhancements (Post-POC)
- Integrate additional ancient text sources beyond TLG
- Implement a flexible citation system supporting various academic standards
- Optimize performance for large-scale text processing
- Enhance error handling and logging across all components

This roadmap reflects the current state of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App. We have completed the initial setup, implemented the corpus management system, developed the initial NLP pipeline, and successfully integrated a centralized logging system. The next phase will focus on implementing the lexical value generation system and its integration with the existing NLP pipeline. Future enhancements, such as expanding beyond TLG and implementing flexible citation options, are noted for development after the initial proof of concept is completed.
