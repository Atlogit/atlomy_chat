This roadmap reflects the current state of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App. We have made significant progress in implementing core features such as the corpus management system, NLP pipeline, lexical value generation, LLM integration, and a modern web interface. The next phase will focus on optimizing these systems, expanding test coverage, and preparing for the development of additional user-facing features like the chatbot interface.
