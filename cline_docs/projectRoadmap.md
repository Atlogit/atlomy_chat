This roadmap reflects the current state of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App. We have successfully implemented parallel processing, batch operations, and significant improvements in testing and API handling. These enhancements have improved the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of the application. We've also addressed the "socket hang up" issue by implementing background tasks for long-running operations and ensuring single attempt creation for lexical values. Recent improvements to the corpus manager frontend have enhanced the user experience with better state management and loading feedback. The next phase will focus on developing the chatbot interface, fact-based response system, and further refinements to our testing and API integration strategies.
