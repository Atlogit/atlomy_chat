## Completed Tasks
- Set up project structure and essential files
- Created initial documentation (projectRoadmap.md, currentTask.md, techStack.md, codebaseSummary.md)
- Analyzed existing codebase and example files
- Developed detailed requirements document
- Implemented and tested centralized logging system
- Developed initial NLP pipeline for ancient Greek text processing
- Fixed import issues in TLG Parser and ensured all tests are passing
- Implemented lexical value generation system
- Integrated LLMs and Langchain for advanced text processing
- Created LexicalValueGenerator class with robust error handling and logging
- Integrated LexicalValueGenerator with CorpusManager and TLGParser
- Updated playground.py for interactive testing of LLMAssistant and LexicalValueGenerator
- Created basic unit tests for LexicalValueGenerator
- Updated system_architecture.md and README.md to reflect new components

## Next Steps
- Finalize and optimize the lexical value generation system
- Enhance the integration between LexicalValueGenerator and other components
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed lexical values
- Explore parallel processing for handling multiple lexical value generations
- Implement a feedback mechanism to improve generated lexical values
- Expand unit test coverage for LexicalValueGenerator and related components
- Create comprehensive user guide for LexicalValueGenerator
- Design user-friendly chatbot interface
- Plan fact-based response system implementation
- Research additional ancient text sources for future integration
- Investigate academic citation standards for flexible formatting

## Current Focus
- Finalizing lexical value generation implementation and integration
- Optimizing performance and accuracy of lexical value generation
- Enhancing system flexibility and extensibility for future improvements

## Future Enhancements (Post-POC)
- Integrate additional ancient text sources beyond TLG
- Implement a flexible citation system supporting various academic standards
- Optimize performance for large-scale text processing
- Enhance error handling and logging across all components
- Implement advanced caching and data management strategies
- Develop user interface for interacting with processed texts and lexical values
- Explore possibilities for academic collaboration and publication

This roadmap reflects the current state of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App. We have made significant progress in implementing core features such as the corpus management system, NLP pipeline, lexical value generation, and LLM integration. The next phase will focus on optimizing these systems, expanding test coverage, and preparing for the development of user-facing features like the chatbot interface.
