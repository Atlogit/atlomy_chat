# Production Release Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for executing a production release using our GitHub Actions workflow.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository access
- AWS credentials
- Deployment permissions
- Approval from at least 2 maintainers

## Release Workflow Steps

### 1. Prepare Release
1. Ensure all code changes are merged to the production branch
2. Run local tests and validations
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   python config_validator.py
   ```

### 2. Initiate Deployment
1. Navigate to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Production Deployment" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter release version (e.g., v1.0.0)

### 3. Workflow Stages
#### a. Release Validation
- Semantic version check
- Security vulnerability scan
- Comprehensive test suite

#### b. Deployment Approval
- GitHub issue created for manual review
- Requires 2 maintainer approvals
- Review:
  - Test results
  - Security scan
  - Release notes
  - Deployment configurations

#### c. Production Deployment
- AWS credentials validated
- Deployment script executed
- GitHub release created

### 4. Post-Deployment
1. Verify deployment
   ```bash
   # Check deployment logs
   tail -f logs/deployment.log
   ```
2. Run smoke tests
3. Monitor system performance

## Troubleshooting
- Check GitHub Actions workflow logs
- Review deployment logs
- Contact technical lead if issues persist

## Rollback Procedure
```bash
# If critical issues are discovered
./rollback.sh v1.0.0
```
