# Project Context: Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App

## Quick Start Guide for LLM-Coder

1. **Current Task**: Finalize and optimize the lexical value generation system
   - Review and refine the implemented lexical value generation system
   - Enhance integration with existing NLP pipeline and other components
   - Implement performance optimizations and advanced features

2. **Next Steps**:
   a. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed lexical values
   b. Explore parallel processing for multiple lexical value generations
   c. Develop a feedback mechanism to improve generated lexical values
   d. Expand unit test coverage for the lexical value generation system
   e. Create comprehensive documentation for the LexicalValueGenerator

3. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `/cline_docs/currentTask.md`: Detailed breakdown of current objectives
   - `/cline_docs/techStack.md`: Overview of technologies and libraries used
   - `/cline_docs/requirements.md`: Project requirements, including lexical value generation specs
   - `/cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`: Overall project plan and progress
   - `/src/lexical_value_generator.py`: Core lexical value generation functionality
   - `/src/playground.py`: Interactive testing environment for LLMAssistant and LexicalValueGenerator
   - `/tests/test_lexical_value_generator.py`: Unit tests for LexicalValueGenerator

4. **Tech Stack Highlights** (refer to `/cline_docs/techStack.md` for full details):
   - Python 3.x
   - spaCy and custom models for NLP
   - AWS Bedrock for LLM integration
   - JSONL for annotated text data
   - JSON for lexical entries
   - pytest for testing

5. **Recent Updates**:
   - Implemented LexicalValueGenerator with robust error handling and logging
   - Integrated LexicalValueGenerator with CorpusManager and TLGParser
   - Updated playground.py for interactive testing of LLMAssistant and LexicalValueGenerator
   - Created basic unit tests for LexicalValueGenerator
   - Updated system architecture documentation and README

6. **Project Structure**:
   - `/src/`: Core application code
   - `/cline_docs/`: Project documentation
   - `/tests/`: Test suites

7. **Key Considerations**:
   - Ensure the lexical value generation system effectively handles ancient Greek medical texts
   - Focus on optimizing performance and accuracy in generating lexical values
   - Implement advanced caching and data management strategies
   - Plan for handling edge cases, ambiguities, and variations in ancient Greek terminology
   - Maintain comprehensive unit tests, especially for complex lexical value generation scenarios

8. **Development Guidelines**:
   - Continue following test-driven development practices
   - Keep documentation updated as you implement new features and optimizations
   - Use the existing logging system for error handling and debugging
   - Ensure compatibility with the current data structures (JSONL for annotated texts, JSON for lexical entries)
   - Focus on modular and extensible design for future enhancements

9. **Getting Started**:
   - Review the current task details in `/cline_docs/currentTask.md`
   - Familiarize yourself with the updated tech stack in `/cline_docs/techStack.md`
   - Examine the lexical value generation implementation in `/src/lexical_value_generator.py`
   - Check the overall project progress in `/cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`
   - Start planning performance optimizations and advanced features for the lexical value generation system
   - Review and expand the unit tests in `/tests/test_lexical_value_generator.py`

By focusing on these points and reviewing the mentioned documentation, you should be well-equipped to continue refining and optimizing the lexical value generation system, enhancing its integration with other project components, and implementing advanced features to improve the overall functionality of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App.
