# LangGraph Documentation Reference

## Introduction

LangGraph is a library for building stateful multi-actor applications with large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to model complex workflows as graphs, where nodes represent different steps or actors in the process, and edges define the flow of information between them.

## Key Features

- Graph-based modeling of LLM application workflows
- Support for complex, stateful interactions between multiple LLM-powered components
- Integration with LangChain for seamless use of LangChain components
- Flexible architecture allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous execution

## Core Concepts

### Graph

The main class for defining the structure of LLM applications. Graphs in LangGraph consist of nodes (steps or actors) and edges (connections between nodes).

### Node

Represents a single step or action in the graph. Nodes can be LLM calls, tool uses, or any other computational step.

### Edge

Defines connections and data flow between nodes. Edges determine how information is passed from one node to another.

## API Reference

The LangGraph API is structured around several key modules:

- `graph`: Core graph construction and execution. [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/api_reference/langgraph/graph.html)
- `pregel`: Implementation of the Pregel model for graph processing. [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/api_reference/langgraph/pregel.html)
- `channels`: Communication channels for graph components. [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/api_reference/langgraph/channels.html)
- `prebuilt`: Pre-built components for common graph structures. [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/api_reference/langgraph/prebuilt.html)
