# Codebase Summary

This document provides an overview of the project structure and key components of the Ancient Medical Texts Analysis App.

## Key Components and Their Interactions

[Previous content remains unchanged up to the Lexical Value Generation section]

8. Lexical Value Generation (`src/lexical_value_generator.py`)
   - Generates comprehensive lexical entries for medical terms
   - Uses Claude-3-sonnet for efficient and accurate generation
   - Implements single lexical value creation process
   - Integrates with Corpus Manager and reference systems
   - Provides structured lexical entries with rich metadata
   - Implements error handling and comprehensive logging
   - Supports asynchronous task-based creation process

## Data Flow

[Previous content remains unchanged up to the Lexical Value Flow section]

3. Lexical Value Flow:
   - User input → Lexical Value CLI/Web Interface → Lexical Value Generator
   - Lexical value requests → LLM generation → Storage
   - Updates and deletions → Storage → Version history tracking

## Recent Improvements

1. Testing Setup:
   - Updated Jest configuration to support TypeScript and JSX
   - Added Babel presets for React and TypeScript
   - Improved test coverage for API interactions and error scenarios

2. API Handling:
   - Implemented a reusable `useApi` hook for consistent API call management
   - Added retry mechanism for improved reliability
   - Integrated progress tracking for batch operations
   - Standardized error handling across all API interactions

3. Error Handling:
   - Implemented an ErrorBoundary component for graceful error management
   - Improved error reporting and display in UI components

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implemented caching in the `useApi` hook for frequently accessed data
   - Optimized batch operations with progress tracking

5. Reliability Enhancements:
   - Increased default timeout for API calls to 5 minutes
   - Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff in the `useApi` hook
   - Added retry count for status checks in the CreateForm component
   - Improved error handling and user feedback for long-running operations
   - Updated CreateForm component to handle potential retries and provide better feedback

6. Lexical Value Generation:
   - Transitioned from parallel to single lexical value creation process
   - Updated API to use LexicalValueGenerator instead of ParallelLexicalGenerator
   - Improved reliability and consistency in lexical value creation
   - Simplified the backend process while maintaining the existing frontend interface
These improvements enhance the reliability, maintainability, and developer experience of the project, ensuring a more robust and efficient application. The latest changes specifically address the "socket hang up" issue and improve the reliability of lexical value creation, providing a better user experience for long-running operations.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct thorough testing of the new single lexical value creation process
2. Monitor and analyze the performance of lexical value generation
3. Update user documentation to reflect the change in lexical value creation process
4. Consider optimizing the single lexical value creation process for improved efficiency
5. Evaluate the impact of the change on overall system performance and user experience
