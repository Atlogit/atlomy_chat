Key Points from Schema:
Sentences Table:

Each sentence has a unique ID.
It stores the complete content of the sentence.
References to source lines via source_line_ids.
Positional information (start_position, end_position) for mapping tokens back to their original lines.
NLP analysis data stored in spacy_data and categories extracted from this analysis.
Sentence-TextLine Association:

A many-to-many relationship between sentences and text lines via the sentence_text_lines table, which tracks positions within each line.
Key Points from Sentence Processing Flow:
Line to Sentence Reconstruction:
Lines are grouped into complete sentences using a SentenceParser.
Handles special cases like quotations and abbreviations.
Complete Sentence Processing:
Each sentence is processed through the NLP pipeline for linguistic analysis.
Token Mapping:
_map_tokens_to_line method maps tokens back to their source lines based on character positions.
Key Points from Sentence Model:
Attributes:

id: Unique identifier for each sentence.
content: The complete content of the sentence.
source_line_ids: List of IDs referencing text lines that make up this sentence.
start_position, end_position: Positional information to map tokens back to their original lines.
spacy_data: NLP analysis data for the sentence.
categories: Categories extracted from spaCy analysis.
Relationships:

Many-to-many relationship with TextLine via sentence_text_lines.
One-to-many relationship with LexicalValue.
Next Steps:
Verify Sentence Handling in Code:

Ensure that the SentenceParser is correctly reconstructing sentences from lines.
Confirm that NLP processing is applied to complete sentences.
Verify token mapping logic.
Check Database Schema:

Ensure that the schema matches the expected structure for storing and retrieving sentences.
Update NLPPipeline Usage:

Ensure that the NLPPipeline processes complete sentences correctly.
Validate that NLP analysis data is stored accurately in the database.
Implement Sentence Storage and Retrieval:

Write tests to ensure that sentences are stored and retrieved correctly from the database.
Implement any necessary updates or migrations to existing code to use the new schema and processing flow.
Let's start by verifying the SentenceParser functionality. Do you have a sample text file or lines that I can use to test this process? If not, we can create a simple example for testing purposes.
