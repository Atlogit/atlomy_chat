## Pagination and Large Result Set Handling Improvements

### Completed Work
1. Enhanced Citation Service Redis Storage
   - Implemented robust error handling for large result sets
   - Added retry mechanism for Redis key storage
   - Improved logging for citation processing
   - Maintained full result set processing capability

2. API Modifications
   - Updated LLM API to handle comprehensive query results
   - Added flexible error handling for different query types
   - Improved type handling for usage metrics

### Current Challenges
- Large citation result sets (2134+ citations) causing issues with LLM input processing
- AWS Bedrock model input length limitations preventing lexical value creation

### Next Assignment: Lexical Value Creation for Large Result Sets
#### Proposed Approaches
1. Alternative Input Methods
   - Explore file-based upload to LLM model
   - Develop mechanism to convert large citation sets to structured files
   - Investigate model-specific input handling strategies

#### Key Considerations
- Preserve semantic meaning with limited citations
- Ensure model can extract meaningful lexical information
- Develop flexible, scalable solution for varying result set sizes

#### Technical Challenges
- Determining optimal citation sampling strategy
- Handling file upload to AWS Bedrock
- Maintaining context and information richness

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Analyze current lexical value creation process
2. Prototype citation sampling/truncation method
3. Investigate file upload capabilities for AWS Bedrock
4. Develop proof-of-concept for handling large result sets

### Potential Future Improvements
- Dynamic input length adaptation
- Machine learning-based citation relevance scoring
- Asynchronous processing for very large result sets
