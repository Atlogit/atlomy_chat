# Release Management Guide

## Release Philosophy
- Prioritize stability and incremental improvements
- Maintain transparent and predictable release cycles
- Ensure comprehensive testing and validation

## Release Versioning
- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible features
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Preparation Checklist

### Release Workflow
